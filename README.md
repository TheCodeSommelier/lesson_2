## User input && ENV Args

If you run this small program in the CLI you can use one of these args:

- lowercase => Lowercases the user input
- uppercase => Uppercases the user input
- no-spaces => Strips all of the spaces from the user input
- slugify => Slugifies the user input
- go-nuts => Picks a random argument from one of the above

You can run them like so ```cargo run -- *arg_here*```

Hope you enjoy!
